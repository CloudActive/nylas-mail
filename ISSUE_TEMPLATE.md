<!--

**READ BEFORE CREATING AN ISSUE:**

The current maintainers of this repo no longer have the ability to devote their time to maintaining this project.
At this time, please DO NOT EXPECT any support from the current maintainers.

It is highly recommended that you take a look at Mailspring (https://getmailspring.com/). It is maintained by the original creator of Nylas, and the current maintainers now use it as their mail client.

With that said, we the maintainers:
- Will try to review and merge PRs
- Will more than likely **not** build releases that aren't auto built (only DEB/RPM/DMG files are built currently with Travis CI, EXE files are having issues with AppVeyor)
- Will **not** test releases
- Will try to respond to your Issue/Request, but will **not** take any further action to support it
- Are open minded for driven people to start maintaining this repo
